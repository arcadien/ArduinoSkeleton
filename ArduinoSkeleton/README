This project is a simple skeleton for Arduino projects made with AVR-Eclipse. 
By default, compilation process will give you the whole Arduino basics.

Libraries (SPI, SD..) need to be added into the build path using 
 * Right click on library folder, in projects explorer
 * Select "Resource configurations" then "Exclude from build.."
 * Uncheck checkboxes "Debug" and "Release", and click "Ok"
 * The library is now available.
 
 Fine tuning could be then made to only compile needed files. By default, giving all Arduino 
basics create a bigger code than needed :)
 
 No optimization parameter is given to gcc-avr. It results in a warning :
[...]/include/util/delay.h:90:3: warning: #warning "Compiler optimizations disabled; functions from <util/delay.h> won't work as designed" 
 So feel free to add such options if needed.
